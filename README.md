Digital Farming Using Hydroponics – Optimizing Arugula Cultivation
Project Background and Objective
This project focuses on optimizing the cultivation of arugula (Eruca sativa) using hydroponic systems—a soilless agriculture method where plants are grown in nutrient-rich water solutions. Arugula is valued for its peppery flavor and nutritional benefits, making it a popular choice for both commercial and home growers. The primary goal is to maximize yield and quality of arugula while ensuring efficient resource use and sustainability within a controlled environment.

Methodology and Approach
The study integrates hydroponic cultivation techniques with advanced sensor technology and data analysis. Key steps include:

Continuous Monitoring: Environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, light), nutrient solution pH, and electrical conductivity (EC) are regularly tracked.

Data Analysis: Collected data is processed and visualized using graphs and statistical methods. The analysis reveals strong correlations between factors like light intensity and plant growth, as well as between nutrient solution pH/EC and plant health.

System Optimization: The research identifies optimal ranges for arugula growth:

pH: 6.0–7.5

EC: 0.8–1.4 mS/cm

Temperature: 10–23°C

Light: 12–18 hours per day

Best Methods: Deep Water Culture (DWC) and Nutrient Film Technique (NFT)

Substrate Selection: A mix of 75% peat and 25% fine coir yields the best results in terms of plant height, width, and biomass.

Key Findings and Results
Yield and Growth: Hydroponic arugula grows faster and produces higher yields than soil-based methods, with harvest possible in as little as four weeks.

Resource Efficiency: Hydroponics uses up to 20 times less water than traditional agriculture and allows for year-round production regardless of climate.

Environmental Control: Controlled environments lead to more consistent harvests and healthier plants, minimizing disease and pest issues.

Nutrient Management: Maintaining optimal pH and EC levels is crucial to prevent nutrient deficiencies and maximize growth.

Lighting: Increased light exposure directly correlates with higher growth rates and better yields.

Substrate Impact: The right substrate mix significantly improves plant quality and resource use efficiency.

Advantages of Hydroponic Arugula Cultivation
Higher yields and faster growth cycles compared to soil

Reduced water and fertilizer use

Lower labor requirements

Minimal contamination risk due to closed-loop system

Ability to grow year-round in any climate

Challenges and Future Directions
Nutrient and Environmental Management: Precise control is needed to avoid imbalances and ensure optimal plant health.

Integration of Automation and Machine Learning: Future work will focus on using ML for predictive modeling, real-time adjustments, and automation of resource delivery, further improving efficiency and sustainability.

Genetic Optimization: Exploring genetic analysis for breeding arugula varieties better suited to hydroponic systems.

Seasonal and Substrate Research: Further studies are needed to engineer substrates and environmental controls for consistent year-round production
